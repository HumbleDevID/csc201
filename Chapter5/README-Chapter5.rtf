\f0\fs24 \cf0 This is a four pronged demonstration of nested looping, using an exercise from \'93Introduction to Java Programming: Comprehensive Version (10th Edition).\'94 The exercise is number 5.18 and can be found in Chapter 5. There are four parts to this problem and four corresponding programs. A brief summary of prompt is below, however the four patterns it refers to are not included in this text file.\
